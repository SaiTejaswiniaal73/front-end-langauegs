            CSS positioning allows you to control the layout of HTML elements using properties such as top, right, bottom, and left. Understanding the different types of position properties in CSS—static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky—can enhance the design and functionality of web pages. This article explores these properties with examples, illustrating how each can be applied to achieve various layout effects.
            CSS Layout - The position Property
            The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky).
            
            The position Property
            The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.
            
            There are five different position values:
            
            static
            relative
            fixed
            absolute
            sticky
            Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.
            
            position: static;
            HTML elements are positioned static by default.
            
            Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
            
            An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:
            
            This <div> element has position: static;
            Here is the CSS that is used:
            
            Example
            div.static {
              position: static;
              border: 3px solid #73AD21;
            }
            position: relative;
            An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
            
            Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
            
            This <div> element has position: relative;
            Here is the CSS that is used:
            
            All CSS Positioning Properties
            Property	Description
            bottom	Sets the bottom margin edge for a positioned box
            clip	Clips an absolutely positioned element
            left	Sets the left margin edge for a positioned box
            position	Specifies the type of positioning for an element
            right	Sets the right margin edge for a positioned box
            top	Sets the top margin edge for a positioned box
        </pre>
